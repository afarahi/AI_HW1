### Task 5

The user need to run the code by entering,

```
$ Python main.py HW5
```

The parameters of the model are specified in a JSON file `./inputs/hw5\_parameters.json` 
and the grid is defined in a TXT file `./inputs/grid.txt`. 
By changing the parameters and running the code on can easily reproduce the tables here.
It should work out of the box, if the `numpy`, `pandas`, and `json` libraries are installed.
